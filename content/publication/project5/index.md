abstract: Loop Closure Detection (LCD), also known as the place recognition of pre-visited areas, is a significant optimization module in visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) to reduce the accumulative error over time. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework (MetricNet) for LCD to enhance the detection performance on complex and changeable scenes. Specifically, MetricNet introduces adaptive weighted similarity matrix by combining the feature extraction module and the similarity measurement module to focus on changing appearance over time. Experiments on three typical open datasets demonstrate that the proposed MetricNet outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of precision by up to 15%-40% and recall rate by 10%-30%, proving its promising generalization ability, applicability, and suitability for real-world applications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Loop Closure Detection (LCD), considered a key optimization part in the visual SLAM system, aims to recognize the places where a mobile robot previously visited. Correct loop closure detection benefits visual SLAM systems a lot because it can significantly reduce the position errors that accumulate over time. It enables the system to build a consistent map of the environment. We introduce the adaptive weighted similarity matrix by combining the feature extraction module and similarity measurement module to focus on changing appearance over time. Experiments on three typical open datasets are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.
