abstract: Deployment-independent indoor localization methods, such as inertial tracking and vision-based tracking have been popular for years for they require no extra infrastructure cost. However, many systems require accurate initial positions from the users or other external signals, making it difficult to meet on-demand localization requirements. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose a novel and special map matching system which matches the topology of the floor plan to the spatial structure extracted from the image of the environment taken by the camera of the mobile phone. The proposed system utilizes Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to extract the spatial structure from images and Siamese Network for spatial structure matching. Extensive experiments have been conducted in three different buildings to demonstrate that our system can provide accurate positions without extra infrastructures and manual initial positions.
