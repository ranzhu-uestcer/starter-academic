This work focuses on map-based deployment-independent indoor positioning. Due to the fact that most existing map matching methods rely on the external information of prior site survey or initial positions provided by users, we explore a novel strategy for performing deployment-independent indoor positioning without considering start points. Here, we adopt easily accessible information such as floor plan and real-time video captured by smartphones to determine the location of the pedestrian for the following tracking.
